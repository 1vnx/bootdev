"""
VARIABLES: Variables are how we store data as our program runs. 
  Up 'till now we've been printing data by passing it straight into print().
  Now we're going to save the data in variables so we can reuse it and change it before printing it.

Creating Variables: A "variable" is just a name that we give to a value. 
  We use the "=" sign to assign a value to a variable.
    ex- my_name = daksh

Using Variables: Once we have a variable, we can access its value by using its name.
For example, this will print my name (daksh):
  print(my_name)
