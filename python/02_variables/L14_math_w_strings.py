# Math With Strings --> When working with strings the + operator performs
  # a "concatenation", which is a fancy word that means "joining two strings".

  # Generally speaking, it's better to use string interpolation with f-strings 
  # instead of string (+) concatenation.

first_name = "Lane "
last_name = "Wagner"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)
# prints "Lane Wagner"

# full_name now holds the value "Lane Wagner".
# Notice the extra space at the end of "Lane " in the first_name variable.
# That extra space is there to separate the words in the final result: "Lane Wagner".

"""
We have a second player in our game!

We need to tell each of our players how much health they have left.

(x) Edit line 9 to print Player 1's health: You have 1200 health using string concatenation and the variables provided
(x) Edit line 10 to print Player 2's health: You have 1100 health in the same way

Only print "You have x health" once for each player, nothing else.
"""

#* solution -->

sentence_start = "You have "
sentence_end = " health"

player1_health = "1200"
player2_health = "1100"

# Don't edit above this line ^

print(f"{sentence_start}{player1_health}{sentence_end}") # or print(sentence_start + player1_health + sentence_end)
print(f"{sentence_start}{player2_health}{sentence_end}") # or print(sentence_start + player2_health + sentence_end)

# output -->
  # You have 1200 health
  # You have 1100 health
