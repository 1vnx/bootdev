* Basics types of variables in Python
Python has several basic data types.

1. Strings: In programming, snippets of text are called "strings".
    They're lists of characters strung together.
    We create strings by wrapping the text in single quotes or double quotes.
    That said, double quotes are preferred.
"""
name_with_single_quotes = 'boot.dev' # not so good
name_with_double_quotes = "boot.dev" # so good

"""
2. Numbers:Numbers are not surrounded by quotes when they're declared.
    An integer (or "int") is a number without a decimal part:
"""
x = 5 # positive integer
y = -5 # negative integer

# A float is a number with a decimal part:
x = 5.2
y = -5.2
"""
3. Booleans: A "Boolean" (or "bool") is a type that can only have one of two values: 
    True or False. As you may have heard, computers really only use 1's and 0's. 
    These 1's and 0's are just True/False boolean values.
