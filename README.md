# Hey, lil coding wizards.

I welcome you, to my little world of my programming directory made for my journey at [boot.dev](www.boot.dev/u/1vnx).\
This repository represents my work at boot.dev:

- completed exercises & assignments
- some of my notes from the course
  that I've completed over the backend path. \
